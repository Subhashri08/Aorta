Aorta,Aorta,Screening for AAA in trans and non binary patients,n/a,"At this time we could not find a Canadian reference on this topic. In the UK trans females and non binary patients who were assigned male sex at birth are advised to have an abdominal ultrasound to detect AAA between ages 65 and 80. Trans males can have a screening ultrasound if they wish but the risk of an aneurysm is mentioned as  being less.
